# church
a base for an incremental game and an excuse to learn javascript
this is a game where you take a small church and you grow it into a larger church. there's no flavor text yet so it's purely a Numbers Go Up game, the end goal is to add a bunch of story and add some context to the numbers.

i'll update this further when the flavor gets added, or when there's more of a game to the game
